<a id='welcome'></a>
## Welcome!

In this course, we will use Python to explore datasets, build predictive models, and communicate data driven insights.

Specifically, you will learn to:

- Automate mundane tasks with Python - a powerful and easy-to-use programming language.
- Define the language and approaches used by data scientists to solve real world problems.
- Perform exploratory data analysis with powerful programmatic tools, including the command line, python, and pandas.
- Build and refine basic machine learning models to predict patterns from data sets.
- Communicate data driven insights to peers and stakeholders in order to inform business decisions.

<a id='projects'></a>
## Project Structure

This course will ask you to complete two sets of projects: four short **unit** projects and a longer **final** project (aka, a _capstone_).

### Unit Projects
At the end of each unit, we'll ask you to complete a small project. These enrichment projects require you to synthesize the skills learned in that unit. There are **four** unit projects.

### Final Project

You'll also complete a longer final project, which asks you to apply your skills to a real world problem. At the end of the course, you'll be asked to share your final project with peers and colleagues.

The final project is broken down into four smaller deliverables, which walk you through every step of the data science workflow as you tackle a real world project.

#### Project Breakdown

1. [Project 1: EDA + Chipotle][2-1A]
2. [Project 2: Statistical Modeling][2-1B]
3. [Project 3: Ames Modeling][2-1C]
4. [Capstone Project: Final Project][2-1D]
    - Part 1: Proposal
    - Part 2: Perform EDA
    - Part 3: Model Data
    - Part 4: Present Findings

[2-1A]: https://git.generalassemb.ly/bah-teds3-2021/PROJECT-1
[2-1B]: https://git.generalassemb.ly/bah-teds3-2021/PROJECT-2
[2-1C]: https://git.generalassemb.ly/bah-teds3-2021/PROJECT-3
[2-1D]: https://git.generalassemb.ly/bah-teds3-2021/PROJECT-CAPSTONE

<a id='software'></a>
## Course Software
We will be using Anaconda, a Python distribution made specifically for data science. Anaconda provides all necessary software for the course in a single install. For example, it includes Python, Jupyter Lab, and popular data science libraries.

- To avoid conflicts, first uninstall any non-Anaconda Python installation (e.g. what you installed during prework).
    - On Windows, go to Start->Settings->Apps. Select Python. Click Uninstall.
    - On Mac, in the command line run `brew uninstall python`.
    - On Ubuntu Linux, in the command line run `sudo apt-get remove python3.6`.

- Install [64-bit Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
    - On Windows, check the box that will add Anaconda to your PATH -- disregard the warning.
    - Install Anaconda only for the current user.
    - Other than these, install using the default options.

- Install a text editor, e.g. [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- **PC only.** Install [Git Bash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)

To test your installation, from the command line run:

- `python --version`  
    Should be Python 3.8.5.
- `jupyter lab`   
    Should display a lot of text and auto-open your web browser (when you want to exit, press Cmd+C).

We'll be using Slack for our in-class communications. Slack is a messaging platform where you can chat with your peers and instructors. We will use Slack to share information about the course, discuss lessons, and submit projects. Our Slack homepage is [DataScienceFundamentals](https://dsfundamentals.slack.com/).

**Pro Tip**: If you've never used Slack before, check out these resources:

<a id='hours'></a>
## Office Hours
Every week, your instructional team will hold office hours where you can get in touch to ask questions about anything relating to the course. This is a *great opportunity* to follow up on questions or ask for more details about any topics covered so far.

**Office hours with your IAs will be every day (Week 3+ from Monday to Thursday) from 1:30 PM to 3:30 PM, or virtual office hours via video call**

The instructor (Dan) will be available the hour after class, Friday mornings, and on Slack. If you would like to meet with him outside these times, please Slack him to schedule an appointment.

<a id='feedback'></a>
## Student Feedback

Throughout the course, you'll be asked to provide feedback about your experience. This feedback is extremely important, as it helps us provide you with a better learning experience. We read every piece of feedback!

The Exit Ticket will be administered 5 minutes before the end of each class. A link will be sent out on Slack.
